# Introduction: Uber Data Analysis
Uber is a transportation company with an app that allows passengers to hail a ride and drivers to charge fares, with an estimated price that is dependent on the destination as well as the demand at the time, and get paid. More specifically, Uber is a ridesharing company that hires independent contractors as drivers. It's one of many services today that contribute to the sharing economy, supplying a means of connecting existing resources instead of providing the physical resources themselves.

Uber links passengers with drivers using the Uber app. Generally, the drivers own their own car. The company does also offer rental or lease on cars through third party partners like Hertz, Get Around and Fair. UberFleet is an app for those managing squads of drivers.

Uber, as a ride-hailing company, relies heavily on data science and analysis to support its day-to-day operations and provide hassle-free rides and deliveries to customers. Data science is a critical component of Uber's operations, and the company invests heavily in its data science and technology capabilities.

## Objective
The objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis is to:
- break down the data location pockets,
- identify these pockets based on the demand parameters that show up, then
- figure out how to position the supply chain in these specific areas.

**The Key Analysis Components:**
- Discovering the locations with the most traffic
- Uncovering the variance in the Trip Purpose and the effect on the Trip Rate
- Discovering the weekdays with the most traffic
- Uncovering the trip rate grouped by Minutes
- Uncovering the Miles travelled under each Trip Purpose grouped by the Trip Category

## Conclusion
The Key Analytic Metrics so far reveals the anticipating demand patterns, and placing driver partners across those hubs with the aim to plug in the demand, lower Estimated Time Arrival (ETAs) and increase overall efficiency.

## Implication
The Uber Data Analysis uses Uber historical data as a benchmark and predicts future action by identifying pockets within the city that witness extremely high demand within a specified range of time.

## Limitation
While Uber generally increases the convenience and efficiency of ridesharing using its app, there are ways in which this method of offering and getting rides can create new challenges for passengers and drivers alike.

Primarily, passengers need access to an app-capable device and an internet connection in order to hail an uber. Passengers cannot hail an uber directly from the street. Not having a smartphone or computer prevents someone from using Uber to hail themselves a ride.

In addition, although Uber drivers must pass a background check to become a driver, it's not perfect, and Uber does not independently test driver skills in the hiring process. This results in inconsistencies in driver quality, which leads to customer complaints and potentially a damaged reputation for Uber.

Because the company manages employment and facilitates rides remotely, it's nearly impossible for the company to adequately handle incidents over such a large breadth of contexts and interactions. This is problematic for both riders and drivers.

Uber's dynamic pricing model can also cause difficulty for the drivers who rely on Uber as their primary source of income, because fares can change quickly, and changes are difficult to predict.

## Further Research
As the goal is to drive efficiency across all areas of business, an A/B testing would be necessary to find the most optimized and effective communications that had to be dispatched to driver-partners to address their issues, and convert drivers to become loyal Uber partners by incentivizing. Also to make the process for a driver-partner signing up on our platform easy and scalable, so that they can reach out for specific issues, such as using the app.
